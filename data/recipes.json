    "description": "Learn how to make perfect sushi rice with this simple step-by-step recipe. Make a batch and craft your own sushi selection platter for entertaining",
    "time": 15,
    "preparation": [
      "To make the rice, first wash it thoroughly in a sieve for 4 mins, gently turning it over by hand until the water runs clear. Drain the rice and put it in a pan with 540ml water.",
      "Leave it to stand for a minimum of 30 mins. It can be left overnight, but for best results, leave it for 30 mins-1 hr. Leave the soaking water in the pan with the rice and bring to the boil, put the lid on, reduce the heat and simmer for 8 -9 mins. Turn the heat off and let it stand with the lid on for a further 5 mins. Do not lift the lid.",
      "While the rice is cooking, to make the sushi-su, put the rice vinegar, sugar and 1 tbsp salt into a pan and leave on a low heat until the sugar and salt have dissolved. Be careful not to let it boil or the flavour will spoil. Remove from the heat and leave to cool.",
      "Put the rice into a wide flat dish such as a sushi oke, a baking dish or a roasting tray. Pour the sushi-su over the rice and fold it carefully into the rice with a wooden spoon as it cools down, being careful not to damage the grains. You can use a fan or a hairdryer on the coolest setting to speed up the cooling process, directing it at the rice. The sushi-su gives the rice more flavour and that familiar sticky glazed look.",
      "If you don’t want to use the rice immediately, cover it with a damp cloth so that it doesn’t dry out. Leave in a cool place, but do not refrigerate. The fridge will make the rice hard and dry, and the sushi-su helps to preserve the rice without refrigeration. Will keep for a day."

    "time": 35,
    "preparation": [
      "Weigh the flour out into a large bowl. Rub in the softened butter using your fingers until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Add the yeast and sugar to one side of the bowl, and the salt on the other. Using a spatula, mix everything together to combine.",
      "Make a well in the centre and pour in 300ml warm water. Using the spatula, mix until you have a rough dough. Tip the dough out onto the work surface and bring together into a large mound.",
      "Knead the dough by hand for 10-15 mins or in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook for 6-8 mins on high speed until smooth and elastic. Oil a large bowl and drop in the dough. Cover and leave to prove somewhere warm for 1 hr until doubled in size.",
      "Once the dough has doubled, tip it out onto the work surface and flatten it to remove any air pockets. Sprinkle over the halloumi in an even layer, then the chipotle flakes. Fold the dough over and knead in the cheese and chilli until evenly distributed. Line a large baking tray with baking parchment.",
      "Tuck the edges of the dough into the centre until you have a neat dough ball. Transfer this to the tray, seam-side down, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to prove for another hour until doubled in size again. You will know the dough is ready when you poke it with your finger – if it springs back slowly and a small indent remains, it’s ready.",
      "Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 7 with a roasting tin on the bottom shelf. Uncover the dough and lightly sieve some flour over it. Cut a cross into the top using the tip of a sharp serrated knife.",
      "Put the loaf on its tray into the roasting tin, then pour some hot water into the tin around the tray to create steam while baking. This will give you a crisp crust. Bake for 20-25 mins until the loaf is golden and sounds hollow when you tap the base.",
      "Remove from the oven and and leave to cool on a wire rack. Cut into slices and enjoy with lashings of butter."

      "Let the chuck roast sit at room temperature for 35-45 minutes before placing it into your grill or smoker.",
      "Preheat your pellet grill to 250 degrees F.",
      "Apply a thin coat of mustard (or hot sauce) to both sides of the chuck roast.",
      "Combine rub ingredients and apply evenly to the roast.",
      "Place onto your grill, close the lid, and cook for 2 hours.",
      "After this time, you will notice a nice bark forming on the meat. You will also notice some dry spots. That means it’s time to spritz with a little liquid.",
      "Combine 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar with 1/4cup water. Place it into a clean spray bottle and spray (mist or spritz) the meat. Do this every 30 minutes until it is time to wrap.",
      "Butcher Paper option: Once the meat reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, it's time to wrap it.",
      "Remove the roast from the grill and place it onto a large piece of pink butcher paper.",
      "Increase your grill temperature to 300 degrees F.",
      "Wrap the roast and return to your pellet grill for another 2 hours or until it reaches an internal temperature of 200 degrees F.",
      "Aluminum foil/steaming option: Heat beef broth before wrapping. Do not add cold or room temperature broth to the chuck roast. The broth should be the same temperature as the roast. The object is to maintain the temperature of the chuck roast, not reduce it. Heat the broth on your stovetop, side burner, or microwave.",
      "Tear off a large sheet of foil, place roast in the center, and curve the foil’s sides upward. Slowly pour 1/2 cup broth around the edges of the chuck roast. Carefully, finish wrapping and place it back into your pellet grill for another 2 hours or until it reaches doneness.",
      "Once cooked, remove your chuck roast from the grill. Wrap it in towels and let the meat rest for 1 hour before carving or shredding it.",
      "If your gathering is several hours away and your chuck roast is done, with thick kitchen towels and place it in a clean cooler to keep warm.",
      "Before serving, unwrap it, slice or shred, and serve."

    "preparation": [
      "Cook the pasta following pack instructions, reserving a mugful of the pasta water and draining it 2 mins before the stated time. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a deep, non-stick pan over a low-medium heat, then tip in the aubergine. Stir well to coat in the oil, frying until softened and deeply golden all over, around 10-15 mins. Remove to a bowl and pour the remaining oil into the pan. Once hot, tip in the onion with a pinch of salt and fry for 5-7 mins until just softened before stirring in the peppers and courgettes. Cook for a further 15-17 mins until lightly browned then add the garlic. Cook for a couple of minutes until fragrant. Stir in the tomato purée and allow it to caramelise for 5 mins. Pour in the cooked aubergine, tomatoes, basil stems and half of the basil leaves. Bring to a gentle simmer. Leave to bubble away for 20-25 mins, then season to taste.",
      "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Mix in the cooked pasta along with a generous splash of the cooking water. Season the mixture well to taste and tip into a baking dish. Combine the cheeses with the panko and a large pinch of black pepper, then scatter this over the pasta. Will keep frozen, well covered, for up to three months. Defrost thoroughly before cooking, or cook from frozen covered in foil for 40 mins, then uncovered for a further 20 mins until piping hot throughout.

      "Drain the pasta, keeping 200ml of the pasta water. Tip the pasta and 100ml of the pasta water into the pan with the butter and pepper. Toss briefly, then scatter over the parmesan evenly, but don’t stir – wait for the cheese to melt for 30 seconds, then once melted, toss everything well, and stir together. This prevents the cheese from clumping or going stringy and makes a smooth, shiny sauce. Add a splash more pasta water if you need to, to loosen the sauce and coat the pasta. Serve immediately with a good grating of black pepper."

    "time": 25,
    "preparation": [
      "Line an 18-20cm square baking tin with a strip of baking parchment, leaving the ends overhanging – this will help you lift the cheesecake out later. Put the butter in a large heatproof bowl that has a wide lip and set over a smaller heatproof bowl filled with boiling water from the kettle. Leave to stand for a minute, then stir until completely smooth. Stir in the crushed biscuits, then spoon the mixture into the prepared tin, pressing it down using the back of a spoon.",
      "Beat the soft cheese, icing sugar, peanut butter and vanilla together in a bowl until well combined. Whisk the double cream in a separate bowl until it’s just holding its shape. Gently fold this into the peanut butter mixture, then spread over the biscuit base and smooth the surface using the back of a spoon. Chill for at least 1 hr to set. Will keep chilled for up to one day.",
      "Meanwhile, tip the jelly cubes into a heatproof bowl and pour over 100ml boiling water. Stir to dissolve, then add the raspberries and sugar and stir, crushing the berries with the spoon. Push through a sieve into a jug, then pour this over the set cheesecake. Chill for at least 4hrs. Will keep chilled for up to two days. Run a knife around the sides, then use the overhanging parchment to lift the cheesecake onto a board. Cut into squares."

    "name": "Rotisserie Roast Beef",
    "description": "Using the rotisserie for this recipe not only gives you flavorful beef roast, but it also helps to keep the meat moist and tender. Eye of round is naturally a tough cut of meat, but the rotation of the rotisserie helps baste the roast as it cooks. I recommend using a meat slicer to cut this, and you’ll have the best roast beef sandwich you’ve ever tried.",
    "time": 120,
    "preparation": [
      "Preheat grill for medium-high heat. We will be cooking this roast indirectly, so set up your grill accordingly.",
      "Combine the salt, black pepper, onion powder, and granulated garlic in a small bowl. Season roast liberally with mixture.",
      "You’ll need to create a pilot hole through the center (lengthwise) of the roast. This will help guide the rotisserie rod through. Once you’ve made the pilot hole and have run the rod through the roast, secure the forks.",
      "Place the rod onto the rotisserie until on the grill and set the aluminum pan underneath. Fill the pan with hot water, close the lid, and cook the roast for 1 1/2 hours. Check ever so often to make sure the drip pan hasn't gone dry. Add more water if needed. The liquid makes a great jus or gravy once the roast is done.",
      "I recommend cooking until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees F., between medium and medium-rare. Watch for shrinkage as the meat cooks, and adjust the forks if needed.",
      "Once the roast is cooked, remove from heat with rod and forks still intact. Heat resistant gloves work really well for this job. Place onto a clean wooden cutting board, loosely tent with aluminum foil, and let the meat rest for 20 minutes.",
      "Carefully loosen forks and remove the rod. Cut into thin slices and use however you wish. Serve topped with gravy and mashed potatoes, or use in sandwiches, salads, and wraps."
